# Robot-Attack
Term project for Distributed Systems course. This was a simulation project on a single machine to work on algorithmic aspect of the setup. The project aimed to surround k robots around a static target object with focus on minimising time and movement without robot collision. For direction, used A* search with Euclidean distance as heuristic. Assumed the cost function for every node to be constant. For movement, used coordination algorithm with multicast messages using ring based topology.
